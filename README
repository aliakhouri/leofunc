A simulation of functional directives in leo
---------------------------------------------

Starting points:

1. Best to start with the sphinx-generated docs 

    ./doc/_build/html/index.html

2. Tests
    
    nosetests

    or

    python test_leofunc.py


NOTE: certain tests have some dependencies on external libraries (namely Cheetah templates and pygraphviz). These are entirely optional and may be disabled by commenting out the tests.

3. Open up code.leo in leo

    run scripts in the leo section


Enjoy,
